        <p>
            We are cobblers of the song<br>
            And barkers of the carnival word,<br>
            We are tailors of the light<br>
            And framers of the earth.<br>
            We fish among the elements<br>
            And hunt the elusive green in gray and blue.<br>
            We drink forbidden waters<br>
            And eat an invisible food.<br>
            <br>
            In this time of electronic-mail and facsimile<br>
            Conversation, we send as our voice<br>
            The poem, the bridge, the circuit, the cure<br>
            Whose electricity is made from dreams,<br>
            Whose song is sung in the colors yet unnamed<br>
            Drawn from the solitary études of the soul<br>
            And given up in tender to the world.<br>
            <br>
            How easy to spend a day writing a poem,<br>
            How hard to spend a life writing a thousand.<br>
            A poem, a bridge, a story, a circuit,<br>
            Cures, laws, bowls—<br>
            The warp and weave and waft of iron<br>
            And paper and light and salt:<br>
            We labor for a lifetime<br>
            But take every day off.<br>
            Who knows what to make of us?<br>
            We are not the ribcage, but the legs;<br>
            We are not the steering wheel, but the headlamps.<br>
            We gather happily, if not often. We can’t<br>
            Sit still. We hurry off. Good-bye to us,<br>
            Hello to us, a tip of the hat<br>
            To us, as we go about<br>
            The drumming of our stars.

        <h3>Technology ...</h3> 
        <p>The Liberator or Destroyer of mankind. Every thriving civilization has its own technology. Technology is a tool - an instrument.
        It isn't an intelligence. It hasn't a soul. Technology is like a hammer. One can use it to build. One can use it to destroy.
        Judgement lay with the hand that wields it.</p>

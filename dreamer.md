        <br>
        I've just closed my eyes again<br>
        Climbed aboard the dream weaver train<br>
        Driver take away my worries of today<br>
        And leave tomorrow behind<br>
        <br>
        Oh dream weaver<br>
        I believe you can get me through the night<br>
        Oh dream weaver<br>
        I believe we can reach the morning light<br>
        <br>
        Fly me high through the starry skies<br>
        Maybe to an astral plane<br>
        Cross the highways of fantasy<br>
        Help me to forget today's pain<br>
        <br>
        Oh dream weaver<br>
        I believe you can get me through the night<br>
        Oh dream weaver<br>
        I believe we can reach the morning light<br>
        <br>
        Though the dawn may be coming soon<br>
        There stillâ€¦ <br>
        <br>
        Oh dream weaver<br>
        I believe you can get me through the night<br>
        Oh dream weaver<br>
        I believe we can reach the morning light<br>

        <p class="just-align"><em><span><strong>'Dream Weaver, I believe you can get me through the night...'</strong></span> 
        was a song about someone with infinite compassion and love carrying us through the night of our trials and suffering. None other than God Himself."</em>

        <h3>The Dreamer</h3> 
        <p class="just-align">Although, for some, a dreamer is a nonpragmatic optimist, living in a fantasy world to escape the gravity of reality,
        here, the dreamer embodies CREATIVITY, IMAGINATION, and VISION. The imagination to think and conjure that which is beyond or outside of the established and conventional. 
        The vision to embrace and put into perspective the imaginative. The creativity to conceive and actualize through invention, innovation, and revitalization.</p><!-- just-align -->

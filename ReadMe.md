<h2>Welcome to the Kayman</h2>
<p>This is a personal website designed as a virtual scrapbook. It provides blogging opportunities and focuses on five categories or areas of interest:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Dreamer</li>
    <li>The Maverick</li>
    <li>The Poet</li>
    <li>The Disciple</li>
	<li>The Technophile</li>
</ul>
<p>This site is built with jekyll and bootstrap following the recipe outlined in Marcelo Canina's tutorial <a href="https://simpleit.rocks/ruby/jekyll/tutorials/how-to-add-bootstrap-4-to-jekyll-the-right-way/">"How to Add Bootstrap to Jekyll the Right Way"</a>. Contrary, to his suggestions the bootstrap components are included. It utilizes Github's gh-pages service to host the site.</p>

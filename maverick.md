        <h2>The Road Not Taken</h2>
        <h6><i>by Robert Frost</i></h6>
        <br>
        <p>
            Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
            And sorry I could not travel both<br>
            And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
            And looked down one as far as I could<br>
            To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
            
            Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
            And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
            Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
            Though as for that the passing there<br>
            Had worn them really about the same,<br>
            
            And both that morning equally lay<br>
            In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
            Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
            Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
            I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
            
            I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
            Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
            Two roads diverged in a wood, and I —<br>
            I took the one less traveled by,<br>
            And that has made all the difference.<br>

        <h3>The Maverick ...</h3>
        <p>The non-conformist. The one that travels to the <span><i>"beat of their own drum"</i></span>:
        not yielding to the status quo, but directed by their own inner compass. 
        Always in search of some distance shore. Can not be bound. Can not be defined. Free.</p>

		<h2>The Secret in the Mirror</h2>
		<h6><i>by Alberto Rios</i></h6>
		<br>
		<p>
    		The mirror is dirty from the detritus of dailiness—<br>
            I look in the mirror and am freckled.<br>
            
            A week out from being cleaned, maybe two, maybe more,<br>
            The Milky Way shows itself in the secret silver,<br>
            
            This star chart in my own bathroom,<br>
            Aglow not in darkness but with the lights on,<br>
            
            Everything suddenly so clear.<br>
            It is not smear I am looking at, but galaxies.<br>
            
            It is not toothpaste and water spots—<br>
            When I look in the mirror, it is writing and numbers,<br>
            
            Musical notes, 1s and 0s, Morse-like codes, runes.<br>
            I am looking over into the other side,<br>
            
            And over there, whoever they are, it turns out<br>
            They look a lot like me.  Like me, but freckled.<br>
